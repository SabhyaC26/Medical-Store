# Medical-Store
This is a software that I created for a school project. I created a three tier software for a medical store using Java &amp; SQL.

******************************************************************************************************************************

My client Mr. Pradeep Parihar has long been running “Selection Medical and General Store” in Mumbai. The shop serves the people residing in the nearby area of Khar. He currently employees a handful of people who help him run this shop. 

At present, his shop maintains a physical leger to keep track of all daily transactions. This “manual system” of keeping all the records has now become “tedious and inadequate”. He often “loses” his legers in which he records the transactions. His customers have stopped visiting the store because of the “long time that it takes to record transactions”. 
It has become increasingly hard for Mr. Parihar to manage inventory in his shop. Since the shop is rather “disorganized”, he does not know the location of the medicines, and therefore, does not what quantities to reorder. Furthermore, the employee records are also not maintained well. The employees are frequent victims to, “payroll errors”. I have received this information after interviewing my client.

Since I am a student of computer science and customer of the store, Mr. Parihar has requested me to provide a technical solution in order to revamp the functioning of his store. He has requested me for a “user friendly software” which his employees and him can use with ease. This would help him maintain his records as well as organize his inventory, ultimately making the store more efficient and effective.
